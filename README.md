👋 Hey! I’m a math grad and current MSc student in Big Data Analytics, always curious about how data can help us make better decisions and understand the world a little more.

I’m learning by doing, working with Python, R, SQL... and other tools to explore data, build models, and try to turn complexity into insight.

Still learning and always growing. Feel free to check out what I’ve been working on!
